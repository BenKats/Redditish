# Spillit

## A Reddit-like app with sign-up/log-in functionality,

### TODO: Users can create posts and comment on them. Users can also access their profiles, update their info and see their post history.

Shown in the image below, we planned to have the landing page for signing in, an about page describing the site, profile page and home page that would multiple posts in a grid format.

During the process of designing our site, we discarded the about page and kept the landing page, home page, nav bar and the profile page.

Going into detail for each section, on the landing page to sign up the mandatory fields needed to be filled are the email, password and username. It is optional to fill in alt email, mobile and website. Returning users are able to sign in with the email and password registered. Upon signing up/ logging in would lead to the home page.

The homepage is where all posts and comments are displayed. Posts are arranged from most recent to oldest. Users can create posts and comment on posts. They can only delete their own posts, if a user tries deleting someone else's post they will receive an alert stating they do not have permission to do so. A feature added on the posts is a toggle comments button. By default comments will be hidden and when toggle comments is clicked on it will display the comments under the post. This design was created to condense the length display of the comments under each post.

Lastly the profile page, users are able to click on the edit button and update their email, mobile# and website in the input fields.
